# CAPM-Model
(a) Regress excess stock returns on excess market returns to obtain estimates of the
betas of the five stocks. Compute the standard errors of your estimates.

(b) What are the estimates of the alphas, and the standard deviation of these estimates?
What are the estimates of the standard deviation of idiosyncratic risk?

(c) Compute the sample average excess return and compare the value with the return
predicted by the CAPM. Based on the data, how well does the CAPM predict
the level returns? How well does the CAPM predict relative performance?
